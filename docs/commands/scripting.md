# Scripting
Scripting is a future design idea I had allowing more complex commands(such as API calls) via a basic scripting language that can be placed within the command response section, after having set the command type to `Custom Script`.

The language that will be used for this has not yet been decided. It may be JS or Lua, or something else easy to run and handle.

Information will become available as the function is developed more.
