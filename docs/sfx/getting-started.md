# Getting Started
So you want to have your ears reconfigured for a life of deafness through the power of Twitch commands? Well, my friend, you have come to the right place.

## Create Sound Effect
To setup a sound effect, head over to the SFX page and hit the Add SFX button.
A lot of the options here are similar to what you find on the Commands page(such as cooldowns, permission, etc).
So, we will only go over SFX specific options here as anything else can be found on the Getting Started page for commands.

### Audio File
This one is simple, just click the arrow button and browse to an audio file of your choice.
:::caution
Files are not copied or moved anywhere, the bot will use the audio file where you left it, so if you move or delete it, your effect will no longer work.
:::

### Volume
This is the localized volume for your sound effect. This and the Global volume from the SFX tab on the settings page are used together to determine the total output volume of your sound effect.

Simply set it to the desired volume(preferably above 0 if you plan to actually hear it) and you're good.

### Hosted Service
In future, I may offer a specific service to some users that allows their audio and image files to be uploaded to an external host to be stored and kept for them. This feature is not yet available, but more information on its existence and possible pricing will be available if I decide to implement it.

Once you add the effect, the command will now work!

:::info
Sound effects can only be triggered via Twitch, the commands will not function on Discord.
