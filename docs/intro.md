# Introduction

What this this and how do I make it stop exploding?

## Getting Started

First off, if you don't know me, you probably can't get ahold of this bot. It's closed beta.

When you first launch the bot, you will be presented with a signin page, clicking the signin button will open your web browser, allowing you to sign in to your broadcaster Twitch account. This is required to use the bot, as a lot of alerts and other things will require the bot to be authenticated with your Twitch account.

Once you sign in and authorize the bot in your browser, it will redirect you to a page informing you that you may close the bot.
At this point, return the bot and you should now be greeted with the dashboard page and are ready to start using the bot.

## Connecting Bot Accounts

To actually use this as a bot, you will need to connect a Twitch bot account you have created with the bot.
I will not provide instructions on how to create one, as there is plenty of instructions online.

Once you create a new Twitch account for your bot, you will need to get an OAuth token for it. To do so, visit this page and sign in with your new bot account and authorize it: [https://twitchapps.com/tmi/](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

Once done, visit the Settings tab on the bot, type your bots username in and paste the token into the token box, then click the connect button.

You have now got the bot setup and are ready to use basic features.
For more information on how to setup other features, explore the pages listed in the sidebar.
