# Introduction

What this this and how do I make it stop exploding?

## Getting Started

First off, if you don't know me, you probably can't get ahold of this bot. It's closed beta.

When you first launch the bot, you will be presented with a signin page, clicking the signin button will open your web browser, allowing you to sign in to your broadcaster Twitch account. This is required to use the bot, as a lot of alerts and other things will require the bot to be authenticated with your Twitch account.

Once you sign in and authorize the bot in your browser, it will redirect you to a page informing you that you may close the bot.
At this point, return the bot and you should now be greeted with the dashboard page and are ready to start using the bot.

## Connecting Bot Accounts

To actually use this as a bot, you will need to connect a Twitch bot account you have created. Twitch does not generally make a distinction between real user accounts and bot accounts(They are one and the same), so you just need to go to Twitch and make a new account for your bot.

Once you create a new Twitch account for your bot, you will need to get an OAuth token for it. To do so, visit this page and sign in with your new bot account and authorize it: [https://twitchapps.com/tmi/](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

Once done, visit the Settings tab on the bot, type your bots username in and paste the token into the token box, then click the connect button.

You have now got the bot setup and are ready to use basic features.
For more information on how to setup other features, explore the pages listed in the sidebar.

For connecting Discord, just go to the Discord developer portal, create an app, create a bot on it then copy the Bot token into the Discord bot token field and connect. Instructions for the creation of Discord bots can be found aplenty online.
